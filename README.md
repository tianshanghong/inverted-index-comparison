# Compare Two Inverted Index Files
Compare the differences between the two inverted index output file. Feedbacks (PRs, Issues) and Stars are welcome.

Usage: `usage: python3 mydetect.py <file1> <file2>`

If all inverted index lines in `file1` have the same results in `file2`, the script will print `All passed!` in the console; else, the script will output the difference between two inverted index lines.
